Jamming

Introduction
------------

Jamming is an app that connects to Spotify and allows you to use the search and playlist APIs to create new playlists and save them to the account linked (looking in to adding a log in screen for individual accounts).

This app was part of a project from codecademy.com, that was to be performed outside of their system to test knowledge on the React.js framework.
